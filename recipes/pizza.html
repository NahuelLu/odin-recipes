        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe is amazing to learn how elaborate lasagna</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ball Best Pizza Dough</li>
            <li>⅓ cup Best Homemade Pizza Sauce</li>
            <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese or 2 to 3 ounces fresh mozzarella</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Best Basil Pesto or Basil Cashew Pesto</li>
            <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the pizza dough: Follow the Best Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)</li>
            <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven (here’s the pizza oven we use).</li>
            <li>Make the pizza sauce: Make the 5 Minute Pizza Sauce.</li>
            <li>Prepare the cheese: If using fresh mozzarella cheese, slice it into ¼ inch thick pieces (see the photo). If it’s incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel. </li>
            <li>Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Add the mozzarella cheese. Top with a few pinches of kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven).</li>
            <li>Dollop with the basil pesto. Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
